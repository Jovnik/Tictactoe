TicTacToe To Do List:
- based on the move reverted to, change whos move it is (X or O)
- say that its a draw and keep that tally in the scoreboard component
- go to react docs and see how they implement the move history correctly 
(mine keeps adding moves to the list as you constantly 'go back in time'
- add more classnames for the relevant squares so that theres only inside borders
